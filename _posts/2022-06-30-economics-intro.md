Economics is just a science from where you can study about the fact that people and societies make decisions to get in return the most out of their limited pool of resources. This study helps you to identify the rootcause of the issues, analyzing the behaviours of individuals, firms and social & political instituitions, to observe how well they convert the limited & constrained resources into finished goods & services that best satisfy human wants and desires.

## Recession    
The recession arises when the total amount of goods and services comes to decline.
Recessions are more vulnerable because of two things. 

                Low Output means Low Consumption
                More workers will lose their job because fewer workers will require to produce the low desired goods and services.



If the prices fall quickly and easily, we can overcome the recessions. But, the prices wont quickly and easily fall , the economists have had to develop Antirecessionary policies or tools to eradicate the recession ASAP.
Governement can use two things to fight Recession which I have learned from English Economist John Maynard Keynes, who in 1936 wrote the first macroeconomics book to fight Recessions.
